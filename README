NAME
    Test::Copyright - Verify the consistency of license and copyright
    information

VERSION
    This document describes Test::Copyright version 0.0_1

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::More tests => 10;
        use Test::Copyright;
        copyright_ok()

DESCRIPTION
    Many CPAN authors are enthusiastic in their wish to contribute to the
    open source movement, but relatively unaware of the need for clear and
    consistent licensing and copyright information. This module attempts to
    check the quality of a module from the copyright and license
    perspectives. The following tests are applied:

    That a CPAN::Meta object can be read from the source.
    That the said CPAN::Meta object contains at least one license.
    That the said CPAN::Meta object contains at least one license recognised
    by Software::License.
    That we can read at least one of LICENSE, COPYING or README.
    That the said LICENSE/COPYING/README file contains either the notice or
    the full text (as generated by Software::License) for every license
    listed by the CPAN::Meta object. The matching process is forgiving over
    space and for certain licenses alternative texts may be tried.
    That the said LICENSE/COPYRIGHT/README file (after excluding the license
    texts) contains at least one copyright statement that can be inferred to
    be the default copyright statement for the whole package.
    That the said default copyright statement has at least one final year
    that matches the current year.
    That every perl file has at least one copyright statement.
    That every copyright statement in every perl file is consistent with the
    centralised copyright information.

INTERFACE
  copyright_ok
    This function does all the tests described above.

DIAGNOSTICS
    `Cannot find dummy copyright: %s'
        Because Software::License places the copyright statement in its
        output, we need to extract it for our purposes. This error is raised
        if we fail to do so.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    Test::Copyright requires no configuration files or environment variables
    and in fact at present is stubbornly resistant to any sort of
    configuration.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    None reported.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    This is not beta software. It is proof of concept software. It is being
    released at the earliest possible moment, because widespread adoption
    and feedback from the open source perl community is essential to its
    success.

    The code does not yet allow for files with different copyright holders
    although that is planned for.

    Other things that might reasonably be implemented have not been done.

    Some code was used because it could be easily and quickly copied from
    other modules rather than because it is most appropriate.

    There has been no test coverage analysis.

    Some module quality test modules know how many tests they will actually
    run. This does not and you have to put that in yourself or take
    alternative steps.

    A project such as this is inherently fragile, needing as it does to
    parse texts written for lawyers rather than well-intentioned computers.
    It would be a lot easier if all the perl software tools generated
    copyright and license texts intended for both categories of reader - and
    perhaps even humans as well.

    Perhaps the copyright extraction part of the code could be more usefully
    in a separate module.

    Please report any bugs or feature requests to
    `bug-test-copyright@rt.cpan.org', or through the web interface at
    http://rt.cpan.org.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    I have to express my gratitude to (or possibly annoyance with)
    ingydotnet for provoking me into writing this module.
